We're all very excited about the second iteration of the *Working With Corpora* course at Saarland Uni. Just like last time, we'll be learning a whole host of things, including *Git*, *Python*, *pandas* and *matplotlib*.

The main thing we're doing differently is starting with an introduction to Git and GitHub. We're also putting greater emphasis on student teaching. The hope is that by the end of the course, most students will also have had some practice doing live coding, and showing off how they've put their skills to use in their research lives.

In the next blog post, I'll take you through how to write your own blog post!
