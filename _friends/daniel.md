I'm Daniel, from Melbourne. I've been hanging out at Saarland Uni for a few months now, because of all the interesting projects going on here! I'm in the final months of my PhD candidature, and am currently fiddling about with the subtleties of `LaTeX` to make it look nice.

I'd like to teach
-------------------

I'm going to help out with teaching the basics of Python and Git at the start of the course, and with corpus linguistic mainstays like tokenisation, keywording and concordancing. 

Later, I'm hoping to show off some *pandas*, some *matplotlib* and *Tkinter*. If there's time, I can take everyone though the process of packing up code, making it installable with *PyPI*, and generating websites from documentation via *Sphinx*.

I'd like to learn
-------------------

* R
* Machine learning
* Parallel corpora
